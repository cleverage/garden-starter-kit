Browsersync: Proxyfy JS and CSS files
===============================================================================

The _Garden Starter Kit_ embed a version of [Browsersync](https://www.browsersync.io/).

Browsersync allows to synchronize navigation (click, scroll, …) between several devices.

To configure it, this tool has his own « back-office » accessible by default on port `:3001` (localhost:3001) when your server is running (`gulp connect` or `gulp live`).
